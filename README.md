# achieveHER

## Intro
Through achievHER, we aim to encourage women to take lead positions by addressing barriers in education for young women (through data) and by offering resources for those impacted and those able to make direct impacts. This website was originally coded in 2022 and has been added to github recently.

## Features of the website
- Data visualisations to address the issue mainly showcasing differences in earnings between female and male workers (by educational attainment),illiteracy rate and 
  amount of girls out of school
- Petitions and Donations page
- Resources for students and educators
